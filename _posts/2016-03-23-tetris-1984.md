## Background
Tetris is a very well know game that has existed for ages! If you don't know what [Tetris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris) is, then I feel sorry for you...
Basically, you're supposed to stack these so called tetrominos and clear lines to get the best score possible.

Tetris has been one of my favourite games for a very long time.
I've always been interested in learning new techniques like [ST-stacking](http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/ST_Stacking) for maximizing the score instead of just making perfect stacks all the time.
After countless hours of playing Tetris, I decided that I would create my own Tetris clone in java, I had just started out with learning java at the time.
The result can be seen to the right.
However, there we're lots of problems with my first version of the game:

* It performed very poorly.
* I had around 400 lines of if-statements for collision detection, unique for each block, which means [2800 lines of if-statements](http://38.media.tumblr.com/1e25b6e3621f355ae89cc3eb057307f8/tumblr_mlrl1nT0Lb1rlnnz9o1_500.gif). No wonder the performance was bad.  And after all that, the collision didn't even work properly (what a surprise).
* It used tons of images that were different for every piece, with and without colour (not sure why I did that).

Overall, the game felt a bit weird to play since it didn't really work, so I put it aside for the time being.

### Javascript?!

Time went by and I had learned a lot more programming.
I now knew about this cool thing called Javascript!
So I decided that I would give Tetris another try, and the result of that can be seen to the left.
There were a lot of improvements in this version.
The entire thing consisted of around 300 lines of code and I used only 1 single square image.
I also had a working bag now, which you can read about under "The Game".
Things we're looking good and I was kind of proud of it.
The collision still wasn't perfect, but I decided to leave it as it was.

### Reminder
One day while I was looking through my feed, I saw a [throw back post](https://www.facebook.com/Tetris/photos/a.261961237181794.69437.193637694014149/940355379342373) to the Tetris 1984 version and instantly thought, "I have to recreate this!". So that's when I decided to make yet another Tetris game!


## The Game
Tetris is a fun grid based game where you stack pieces and clear lines to get score.

### Rules
Tetris is normally played on a 10x20 matrix where each piece, or tetromino, is built out of 4 smaller pieces.
The objective is to clear lines, fill entire rows, and gain the highest score.
If you clear multiple lines at the same time you'll get a extra score, and if you clear 4 lines you get a TETRIS!


The game is pretty simple which makes it easy for a beginner to start playing but it's very hard to master.
