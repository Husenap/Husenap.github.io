> Light your way through the game and reach the magical portal of Noor.
A game made by 5 devs over the course of 48 hours.


## The Game

Noor is a mobile game where you play as a small triangle that has to find it's maze through an invisible maze.
The way the game works is that the player acts as a bucket of light.
When the player shoots out light, they can start moving and become a little bit smaller.
The light that is shot stops when it hits a wall, this will guide the player through the maze.
To win a level, the player has to reach the portal at the end of the level.


## My role

For this game I had to do a lot of programming.

I remember staying up all night, programming the tricky touch controllers to handle tap for shoot and hold to move.

I also programmed most of the game logic involving movement, handling the lights and level advancement.

For the main menu I handled the menu buttons and did a simple little animation to the background with code.
