## The Game

The Douche of Wall Street is a simple game where you run around and steal money from people so that you can buy your dreamhouse, but things don't always go as you've planned.

## My role

At the time, I was fairly new to programming, so I spent most of my time on the level design. However, I did program some of the GUI such as the stock market.
