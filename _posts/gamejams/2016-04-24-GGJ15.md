> You are in a cube, with a lot of cubes. Most of the cubes are blocking your way out, but one of them seems anxious to get out. So the question is: what do you do now?


## The Game

![]({{ "/static/img/gamejams/ggj15/VR.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}){:.right-quarter}

This game is a very fun and challenging puzzle game in the form of virtual reality.
To the right is a small screenshot of how it looks in-game.
When you manage to solve a puzzle, you can advance to the next level.

### Diversifiers

*Stephen Hawking Can Play This:* In the game everything (including any menus) can be navigated with one button, without any need for quick / precisely timed presses.


## My role

For this game I programmed the puzzle for the first level, where the cubes rotate and react to the player input.
I also programmed the movement of piper with a crazy function full of sines and cosines to make it look natural and not like a normal sine wave.

Other than programming, I made the cursor in the middle of the screen, the textures on the walls of the cube and I also create a crazy bonus level at the end.
