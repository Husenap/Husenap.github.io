## The Game

Glyph Hunters is a fun social multiplayer game that is played on a shared screen. The idea is that the game will be displayed in a public area where people can jump in and out of the game as they feel.
When you join the game, you're assigned a team colour, and you get to move around the map, there are different types of locations, and when you arrive at one of them, a puzzle appears on your mobile screen. For the jam, we only had time to make a simple puzzle which displayed 4 words, 3 of them rhymed and 1 didn't, so you had to pcik out the one that doesn't rhyme.
You get different points depending on how hard the problem is and in the end, the team with the most points wins.


## My role

For this game, I programmed some of controls for the mobile end of the game.

I also made the puzzle where we had a dictionary of around 700 words that were split up in 3 different difficulty levels, all this was stored in a JSON file. When the player reached a location, the game picked out a specific level of difficulty depending on the location and displayed it to the player. Then I had to handle the answer of the player, if it was correct or wrong, and send that data back to the main game.
