## Background

Ahh, Jalapeño Madness, probably one of the things I've had the most fun making.
At the time of making this game, my description for the game was:

> ## Jalapeno Madness
> 
> A fun and social online game!
>
> You play as *Juan the Jalapeño*!
> 
> Run around with your friends and explore the amazing mexican desert!
>
> <small>&ndash; A Crazy Hussein</small>

The idea for this game came to me one day while I was playing around with the logo for [Hotline Miami](http://www.hotlinemiami.com/), which is an amazing game.
I added jalapeños to the logo and changed the **MIAMI** to **JALAPEÑO**, just for the funs of it.
